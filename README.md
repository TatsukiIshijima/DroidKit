(Quote: [‘TURN EVERYONE INTO AN INVENTOR’: THE STORY OF THE LITTLEBITS DROID INVENTOR KIT](https://www.starwars.com/news/turn-everyone-into-an-inventor-the-story-of-the-littlebits-droid-inventor-kit))

**'Droid Inventor Kit'** is a kit to create a droid.
In addition, the droid can be operated with simple programming from a smartphone.
However, there is a problem.
Currently, [the app has been removed from the store and cannot be installed](https://community.sphero.com/t/droid-inventor-kit-app-gone-from-play-app-store/2783).
So I decided to provide code that can operate the droid from **Swift**.
In short, you can create your own application with this **Swift** package.
